What does a 'doctype' do?

A doctype designates the type of markup the document is using and the version so that the browser knows how to interpret it & what relevant specifications to apply.  There are a couple of different markup languages: HTML, XHTML, XML, and SGML.

HTML is the most popular markup language and HTML5 has the most simplified doctype tag: '<!DOCTYPE html>'.

Before HTML5 the tag used to be:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
