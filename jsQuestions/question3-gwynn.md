* Explain how prototypal inheritance works

 JavaScript does a good job of emulating object oriented programming even thought it isn't designed to work that way from scratch.  The root of this emulation is being able to make a new instance of an object with it's referenced values and methods without having to copy all of them and use up more space.

 Everything in JavaScript is an object, but it can also be said that everything is a function.  All JS functions have a default object property called Prototype which stores stuff.  There are always default methods available to all JS objects, but it can also store more unique methods, particularly for special classes that are already defined in JavaScript like Number, Array, etc. We can also add our own custom methods on Prototype when we want to define our own custom class.

 The advantage is that whenever we create an instance of a class we can access those methods, without duplication, because the JS processor will look for anything it can't find on the instance by going up the prototype chain to our parent class.  This also means that we can override methods that exist on the parent class to fit specific needs, such as for a subclass.
